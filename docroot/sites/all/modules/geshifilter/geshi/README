GeSHi is a generic syntax highlighter, written in PHP. You simply
input the source code you wish to highlight with the language you
wish to use, and the output will be a file syntax highlighted to
XHTML standards.

For more information on how to use GeSHi, please consult the
documentation. If you got this readme from a GeSHi package, then
the documentation is available in the docs/ directory. Documentation
is also available at http://qbnz.com/highlighter/documentation.php

If you think you've found a bug in GeSHi, contact me with a bug
report at oracle.shinoda@gmail.com. Be aware that minor highlighting
errors may well just be incorrect language files, but if you do
find something major please contact me.

COPYING file for more information. If you do modify this program,
please tell me about it! Perhaps you've made a good improvement that
I can learn from :)
