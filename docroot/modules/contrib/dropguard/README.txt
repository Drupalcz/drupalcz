Drop Guard is a service to automate Drupal updates with integration into development
and deployment workflows. To use Drop Guard with your Drupal installation you need
to install this module.

It will collect data about installed modules and themes and send this information
securely encrypted to Drop Guard. Then Drop Guard will retrieve available updates
for your site and care about the updates automatically, together with integration
with your deployment processes.
